# Redact PDF
==========

## Web based tool for redacting PDFs for name-blind recruitment

This tool attempts to remove names, pronouns, email addresses and urls from CVs so that recruiters selecting people for 
interview aren't influenced by the candidates gender. It is not perfect, so I'd recommend a manual check of the results.

## Run locally

There is a script to run the project locally. This starts the app with flags to set the memory settings required to run multiple CVs through.

Run `./startapp.sh` in project root
